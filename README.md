# Discord UI remade in TailwindCSS
This is a slightly tweaked version of Discord's UI remade in TailwindCSS, originally created by [Andre Madarang](https://github.com/drehimself/tailwind-v1-examples).
The project uses Node and ExpressJS to statically render the page.

## Pre-reqs
* NPM v7 or newer
* Node v11 or newer

## Running the project
1. First install the required modules with `npm i`
1. Then compile the css with `npm run tailwind:css`
1. And to start the project, just run `node indejx.js`

Additional thanks to [Catalin Pit](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-use-tailwind-css-with-node-js-express-and-pug-8591c47dd54f) for showing how to set up the local server with TailwindCSS.
