# Discord UI remade in TailwindCSS
This is a slightly tweaked version of Discord's UI remade TailwindCSS, originally made by [Andre Madarang](https://github.com/drehimself/tailwind-v1-examples). Huge thanks for showing how it's done, and showcasing the sheer power Tailwind has!

1. First you need to build the css with `npm run tailwind:css`

1. And to start the project, just run `node indejx.js`

Additional thanks to [Catalin Pit](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-use-tailwind-css-with-node-js-express-and-pug-8591c47dd54f) for showing how to set up the local server with Tailwind.
